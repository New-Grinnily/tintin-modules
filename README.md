This is a collection of small modules, all independent from each other, and tailored for specific guilds.

CURRENT MODULES:
---------------

  For caster classes (Wizards, Witches)
   
    Enchantment Levels
          Displays the current enchantment level of an item in the form of a progress bar.
   
    Delusion Stages

          Displays a progress bar, indicating at which stage of the pampering process the item is at the moment.
          It does not represent in any way the time it will take for the item to complete the process and "turn".

For priests

    Holy Auras
          Substitutes the "flavour" line in amulets, holy symbols, relics and prayer books for a simpler, 
          coloured one which simply states the name of the god to whom the item has been consecrated.

    Faith Rod Charges
          Displays a progress bar per faith rod part, indicating the ritual, if any, that it contains, and the
          degree to which it has been charged.

    Prayer Beads Charges
          Displays a progress bar for a set of prayer beads, depicting the stage to which it has been charged
          and a rough approximation of the holy items it can replace at the time.

CONSIDERATIONS:
   - For most of the level bar modules, a terminal width of 160 columns or higher is required; otherwise the bars will not appear at all.

If you should find any bugs, or if you have any doubts or ideas regarding any of my modules, please feel free to contact me in the game.

New grinnily.
